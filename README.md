## Overview

## Key features

## Why did we create this?


## Assembly instructions

Assembly instructions can be found here: [/docs/assembly-manual.md](docs/assembly-manual.md)

!Note: don't fill your assembly with transparent UV-adhesive before you fully test it and flash with the right firmware.  

## Flashing and testing

Flashing and testing instructions can be found here: [/docs/flashing-n-testing.md](docs/flashing-n-testing.md)

## Using you Kampela Solder Kit

You can use your solder kit as a transaction signer with the real [Kampela firmware](https://github.com/Kalapaja/kampela-firmware)

To do that you need to flash it with latest [binary firmware released](https://github.com/Kalapaja/kampela-firmware/tags) or build it from the [source code](https://github.com/Kalapaja/kampela-firmware)

Or you can make your own version of the firmware and hardware with all needed customisation.
